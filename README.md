# Correction script with CLI

## What's this?

The main idea behind this script is to speed up the process of correcting students' assignments.
This script assumes that you have a directory wherein each student has an own folder.


## How are results stored?

The system was built to be able to sync all points, which the students receive, to a database.
In our case that was done with MariaDB, connecting to it via `mysql-connector-python`.
